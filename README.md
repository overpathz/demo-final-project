# Java Web Application with REST API

!! THERE ARE NO TESTS AND LOGGING

## Overview
This Java-based web application provides a RESTful API with a focus on security and performance. It features user authentication and authorization using JWT tokens, access control based on user roles, and a relational database for persistent data storage. The application is designed with a clean architecture, separating concerns into repository, service, and controller layers, alongside utility classes for common functions.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Weather data fetching and processing from OpenWeatherMap
- CRUD operations for city data management
- Secure REST API endpoints
- Incorporates logging for monitoring and debugging purposes.
- **Project Structure**:
  - `repository`: Data access layer for interacting with the database.
  - `service`: Contains business logic and data processing.
  - `util`: Utility classes and common functions.
  - `controller`: REST controllers to handle API requests.
